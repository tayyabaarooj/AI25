exploration of Whisper + speech APIs:


we can integrate apiss like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech, AssemblyAI
whisper alone will only transcribe the text hoewver using it with othewr speech apis can provide features like real time interactions etc.
ill most porbably go for Google Cloud Speech-to-Tex as it provides free tier and its super simple
